### What I learned

```css
/* Box Shadow at right and bottom of the Card Component */

.proud-of-this-css {
  -webkit-box-shadow: 6px 6px 0px 2px hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
  -moz-box-shadow: 6px 6px 0px 2px hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
  box-shadow: 6px 6px 0px 2px hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}
```

### Useful resources

- CSS Matic (https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - It is a Box Shadow generator which helped in required box-shadow css with good UI interaction.
